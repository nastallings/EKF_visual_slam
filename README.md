# EKF_visual_slam
This is my finally submission for Homework 4. The code can be found here:  https://github.com/nastallings/EKF_visual_slam

The file slamp.py deals with running slam and generating a point cloud.
The file ekf deals with running the ekf algorithm. 
The file main is what needs to be run to run the program and see the final output. 

The output consists of a map of the bots positions and the pointcloud.
